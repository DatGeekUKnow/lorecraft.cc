This article was not how we, the Commune, hoped to be introduced to the world. So we humbly ask you, reader, to let go of all your preconceived notions about the Commune and hear us out.
But first, allow me to introduce myself.</description></item><item><title>The Communists Have Gone Too Far</title><link>https://www.lorecraft.cc/news/opinion_the_communists_have_gone_too_far/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.lorecraft.cc/news/opinion_the_communists_have_gone_too_far/</guid><description>As many in the community may already know, I was recently executed by communists for trading with their villagers. My name is MrWeish, and I’ve only recently joined the server. I have been working hard to build a capitalist paradise on the mountains east of Spawn, which has put me on the border of the large community known as “The Commune”.
The Commune is a communist society built on the backs of the working class.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://www.lorecraft.cc/legal/privacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 23:22:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.lorecraft.cc/legal/privacy/</guid><description>Privacy Policy for Company Name At Website Name, accessible at Website.com, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors.
