This article was not how we, the Commune, hoped to be introduced to the world. So we humbly ask you, reader, to let go of all your preconceived notions about the Commune and hear us out.

My name is MrWeish, and I’ve only recently joined the server. I have been working hard to build a capitalist paradise on the mountains east of Spawn, which has put me on the border of the large community known as “The Commune”.
The Commune is a communist society built on the backs of the working class.</description></item></channel></rss>
