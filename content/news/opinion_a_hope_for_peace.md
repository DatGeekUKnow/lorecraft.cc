I joined the commune hoping to find unity, peace and prosperity, and to learn what it truly means to be a part of this world. The commune sprang up and quickly became a true workhorse. A beautiful collaboration between individuals and their diverse talents, coming together to share resources of their own free will and selflessness. What a beautiful community to be a part of. 

As I ventured out into the world, I discovered other players who had their own ideas about what prosperity looks like. Some decided to claim their own territory. Others decided to build kingdoms. Who was I to question their ways? Some met me with kindness and generosity, while others preferred to stay to themselves. 

Those who were kind to me stuck out. I recall a time I ventured into the Nether all by myself and was lost. A player, not of the commune, generously offered me leather enhanced boots to help me get around and was patient and kind as I learned my way to different portals. Another time, a player graciously offered me food when I was on the brink of death. This player was also not from the Commune. These players did so out of their acts of selflessness and the good of their own hearts. I would love to return the favor to them some day, not out of obligation, or because of fair trade: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a head for a head. No. I wish to pay them back because of their beautiful souls that reached out to me, and in ways that enhanced this temporary life of mine. 

I believe that a world like that is possible, regardless of how you choose to live and interact with others. Can it be possible? 

On Thursday, my fellow Commune-ists disciplined one of members for inciting violence toward our neighbors. Will that be enough to help alleviate the anger and hate? I hope this can help repair relationships and mend the torn trust between fellow players. 

I hope that peace is the right way and that we can all share the abundance of this world together.
