72 hours after a harrowing debate for the Attorney General position and subsequent events, the Commune finds itself as the target of the next greatest challenge. 

TheBeardedCleric announced his resignation from the Commune to focus on his Archival duties. In a statement, Cleric explained, “...with the construction of the Archives and the responsibilities and projects that come as Head Archivist, I feel my loyalties have been torn between my comrades and my role. The Archives are neutral ground, open to all, yet the Head Archivist is aligned with a faction. In order to maintain proper neutrality…I am leaving the Commune.” 

While an understandable and respectful departure, another announcement appeared a mere two hours later that sparked controversy. Three former communists sent the Commune a statement asking for a “voluntary dissolution,” which raised many concerns.

“They’re basically saying, ‘We joined a group knowing that if we left, we would lose everything. Now that we left… I can’t face the consequences of my actions, so gimme please.’” exclaimed TheRecycler. “I don’t know if it’s realistic to ask that we split up property and items since that would be difficult with us owning so many things.”

While some feel the intent may be in good faith, others fear ill-will is upon them.

The Commune will begin discussions and will put a decision to a vote in the near future.

Will this be the end of Communism? We will have to see.
