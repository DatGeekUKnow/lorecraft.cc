In a stunning power move, Server Leader YourLuckyStars7 has vetoed a SWAG proposal which would have declared any players who "sleep next to each other" married.

"I could see this causing problems," Lucky announced after torpedoing Res. 11. It is the first time that a server leader has ever vetoed a SWAG resolution.

The marriage bill was proposed by Lucky's disgraced predecessor TheRecycler. Former Server Leader The Recycler was impeached in March for "dereliction of duty" after only two weeks in office. 

In response to Leader Lucky's veto, TheRecycler immediately proposed Lucky's impeachment. TheRecycler said that Lucky is "interfering" because she "went against the majority's wishes". Currently, the impeachment proposal is on track to fail with a 1-5 vote.

In response to TheRecycler's impeachment proposal, ratat0ing proposed Resolution 13, which would ban TheRecycler from proposing any future impeachment resolutions to SWAG.
