As many in the community may already know, I was recently executed by communists for trading with their villagers. My name is MrWeish, and I’ve only recently joined the server. I have been working hard to build a capitalist paradise on the mountains east of Spawn, which has put me on the border of the large community known as “The Commune”.

The Commune is a communist society built on the backs of the working class. They absolutely despise capitalists like me, who work hard for what we have. Since starting work on my settlement, I have been met with constant hostility from them. One could even say that they have been predisposed to hate me.

While looking for an easier way to get diamond armor, I discovered their villager trading hall. There, I took my own goods and traded with the villagers for a diamond chestplate. I was quickly confronted by Commune members. Normally the Commune is supposed to vote on major decisions, but in my case, they simply declared me guilty on the spot for theft, no trial whatsoever. I had to pay them back for the chestplate with eight diamonds and was then executed so they could take my head and put it on a spike for the whole world to see. Not only was it humiliating, but it was completely undeserved.

For one, I didn’t break any rules. There was no official rule on the server against trading with someone else’s villagers. According to Rule 2 of the Base Rules for Lorecraft, stealing is defined as such: “taking or destroying another player’s private property (items, mobs, etc.) without their permission”. The items offered by the villagers don't belong to the Commune, they belong to the villagers. I didn’t steal the villagers from them. I made a completely legitimate trade with a villager, an item for an item. The Commune came in as an illegal third party and intimidated me to give them payment they were NOT due.

Since I’m a new player, I didn’t know the rules of the server very well. When the Commune members came to intimidate me, they convinced me that I had somehow broken a rule and that I had to pay up. They took advantage of me and continued to humiliate me by putting my head on a spike for the whole world to see. It goes without saying that I also lost many levels when they brutally executed me, just another punishment for a crime I didn’t commit.

With this all being said, it is my firm belief that I have been wronged, and that all players should beware of the Commune. The rapid armament of their members and the increasingly aggressive threats they type into chat have gotten out of hand. I may have been the first to fall victim to these communists, but I surely won’t be the last.

I would like to finish by saying that, while this nasty business has certainly created tension, my businesses will still be open to all Commune members, including my planned state-of-the-art casino where guests can gamble to earn hundreds of diamonds and other high-value rewards. This and many more future businesses will soon be opened at the capitalist paradise, which I would like for everyone to consider as neutral ground where they can come to spend their hard-earned valuables. Together, we can build a brighter (and much wealthier) future.
