Hello everyone!

Christmas time means that the new year is just around the corner. I just wanted to take a moment from the admins and say -- thank you so much for everything you have done!

We have grown so much in the past year, we have ~161 members within our Discord, which is *crazy*! I thank you all for allowing myself the opportunity to administrate the server, especially on a technical level. I truly love getting to work on networking and linux items, and this server gives me the opportunity to practice these skills almost daily.

I also want to thank you for your contributions to the server! As everyone knows, this server is crowd-funded. Each month, we attempt to hit a goal of $36.00 in order to cover most of our operating costs.
