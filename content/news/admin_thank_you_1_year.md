Hello everyone!

We want to genuinely thank everyone who's put time and effort into the LoreCraft Server. Definitely one of the highlights of my day when we can just kick back and hang out with you all on the server. We also want to specifically thank everyone who's donated to keep the server going. We're still crowdfunded, so the server will be kept alive as long as there are people willing to invest in it. It's really great to have an active community all building lore in the same world. Let's keep it up into 2023!
