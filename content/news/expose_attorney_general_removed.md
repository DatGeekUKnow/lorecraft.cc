Yesterday Lorecraft held a debate to hear from our candidates for Attorney General for the people to learn more about each of the candidates to make an educated decision based on responses to questions based on the duties of the Attorney General. At the end of this debate the candidate Unknown_Err0rXD dropped out of the election and publicly declared her endorsement for Ratat0ing. This shocking revelation caused some suspicion, and upon further investigation, it was found that Ratat0ing, commonly referred to as ‘Rat’, had previously spoken to Unknown, and planned for her to do this, along with wanting Unknown to attack fellow candidate, Toria, as well.

This begs the point to be brought up, that during the debate, candidate Toria brought up that Rat was also an admin and could use it to his advantage, to which Rat responded, “I have never done that, and I would never do that, especially in an elected position.” 

When asking for more information from Unknown, she expressed her hesitance about dropping from the election and how she felt pressured due to Ratat0ing’s power as an admin of the Lorecraft server.

Throughout the conversation with Unknown, she repeatedly stated that she was afraid of Ratat0ing and continued to express concern about Rat attempting to retaliate against her coming forward with this information.

With this information, I hope that everyone takes it into consideration when voting for Attorney General.
