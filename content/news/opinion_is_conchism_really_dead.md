Once upon a time, it was believed that there was a magic conch that was said to have possessed powers over the natural world and that it would grant various requests of its followers. A religion was established and, what would be later known as [Conchism](https://newport.fandom.com/wiki/Conchism?so=search)[^1], would take the world by storm. As time passed, many would fall away from Conchism. Some say it’s dead. However, whispers of a player harnessing similar powers to the Magic Conch have begun to surface. 

So, what is Conchism? What does this mean for the new world? To begin, the Magic Conch is a deity that manifests itself primarily in a nautilus shell, but has also been known to manifest itself physically as fellow players. Conchism, established by Rage6838, is “a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of the Magic Conch…” At its core, Conchists, or followers of the Magic Conch, believed the following: 
1. Belief in the existence of the Magic Conch as a spiritual deity
2. The omniscience and infallibility of the Magic Conch
3. The Magic Conch’s ability to manifest itself in nautilus shells and certain animate beings
4. Kipkemboi35 as the physical embodiment of the Conch

While there has been no signs of Kipkemboi35 or any other reincarnation of the Magic Conch today, rumors are spreading about an individual player harnessing the power of teleportation, producing blocks out of nothing, turning night to day in an instance, and more. Upon witnessing these miracles, this individual has amassed a following, with crowds chanting “RMC! RMC!” - whatever that means. 

Will this world experience a Magic Conch 2.0? What does it mean for the new world? Who is this mysterious magic wielder? Would you believe in a new Magic Conch?
