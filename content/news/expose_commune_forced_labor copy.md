Long ago when the most strived kingdom was the Kingdom of Alconhime which at the time was ruled by King Gennath. Hannah was a commoner of that king. She got pregnant at 20 with a daughter, who was later brought into this world named Dana. Her mother had to raise her alone while working multiple jobs barely able to put food on the table. Dana was little, but she could still see the sadness in her mother's eyes. 

One day, Dana applied to a knight school, two years passed and she was awarded the title of “Imperial Knight '', as of her quick learning and the skill that she possessed. Dana was heading home and suddenly found knights standing in front of her home talking to her mother forcefully. Hannah started screaming for her to run. Dana was in a panic not knowing what to do, the knights chased Dana, but with her experience in combat and the skills she possessed, she took down all the knights with ease. Dana hid away with her mother, and filled with curiosity, Dana asked her mom what had happened. Hannah reveals that she and King Gennath had an affair and he never wanted anyone to know he had a child with a commoner. 

Once the news about Dana reached the capital, the King went into a panic and ordered guards to execute Dana and her mother. Knowing this, Dana was filled with rage, the reason why her mother had to suffer alone was because of the King, which was the person she was trained to protect. The guards eventually found them, and while Dana was getting ready to prepare to fight, she was pushed into the river by her mother. She wanted Dana to live a normal and happy life. 

The next day Dana’s mother was executed for a crime she did not commit, while Dana who was filled with anger and vengeance, ended up in The Commune. As the people saw the bounty for Dana, more and more started to hunt her down. Eventually they caught her, then set up an execution at noon. Dana was filled with anger but also sadness, losing her trust in people. As noon came and Dana was about to be beheaded by TheRecycler, but all the sudden out of nowhere a man in a black cape swooped in to save Dana. 

The man later revealed his name to be Rhydian, a traveller who’s former kingdom had perished due to a volcano. The two set out to travel together, and eventually, the two fell in love on the road. Dana and Rhydian started developing the kingdom which we all know today as The Kingdom of Kintenko. 

Dana later recruited a powerful organization as her special unit called “The Shadow Eminence”, which listens to her commands only, not only to protect her, should her father decide to one day come after her again, but also to bring peace and bring evil to justice.
