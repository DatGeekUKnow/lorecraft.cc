Hello all! 

I wanted to take some time to issue a call to anyone that might heed it, as it appears with the commune's latest actions, it may very well be necessary for our own safety. Of course, I am talking about the horrendous Resolution 4.

The resolution that you see an image of above was proposed by TheRecycler, a commune member. This resolution in and of itself shows a lack of caring of human life, and worse off, a lack of respect for players, **period**. This simply cannot stand in our server as of today.

In an effort to (1) organize the free states against the commune to be able to put up a resistance if necessary, and (2) to facilitate trade between the countries involved, I would like to propose to the states of LoreCraft that we join together, in an alliance group. Currently, I do not have a name for it, nor do I need to become the leader of the group. However, I believe this group to be necessary for our continued survival on the server.

This group's main obligation would be to defend one another if we came under attack from the commune, or any other hostile force that appears on the server at any time. This improved security helps us to maintain our ways of life, as they currently stand, and we no longer have to worry about the sun being blotted out by communist arrows.

The group's secondary obligation would be to facilitate trade between the country involved. This will end up being a little more difficult to get through, however I was seeing that we could all agree for a town or location in which we could build shoppes, farms, etc., and only allow the countrymen within the group to be able to come in and trade freely. This would not all be free, and I don't know where this would be located, but that would be up for discussion.

Currently, this is just an idea in my head. However, I would like to see it come to a reality. Please, don't let fear keep you from joining! We will be stronger together, and as we can see from Resolution 4, it looks like we may need that strength too, as the commune and their communists become more and more bloodthirsty, and continue to disregard human life.

If you are interested in joining, please DM @trailhopper27 via discord. Once we have a couple of members, I will create a chat with all of us and we can prepare everything required in order to bring about our new organization.
