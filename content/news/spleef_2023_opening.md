We are welcoming everyone that would like to join, to register for the Spleef event! The season will start with an opening ceremony July 1st, 2023 @ 7:00 pm CDT. During this ceremony, we will announce the bracket, the amount of diamonds that everyone will be playing for, and the possible venues to compete at! We will also go over rules for those bracket matches at that time.

Once the opening ceremony is over, players will have 45 days[^1] in order to complete their matches. Once the days are up, there will be a final competition in the main arena being built in the Trail Alps, and it will be televised for all to see!

Please utilize the form below to register! Note that your registration is not finalized until 8 diamonds is paid to the "pot", which is being kept by trailhopper27.
