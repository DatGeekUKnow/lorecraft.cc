According to an accidental intelligence operation, the commune was found to have a forced labor camp full of villagers captured against their own will. I had the privilege to interview [REDACTED], the player who stumbled upon this sinister plot

“I was interested in joining the commune,” said [REDACTED], “I was observing their land and all the wonderful architecture, but after I saw these atrocities, I felt it was my duty to document them and tell the public the truth.”
 
[REDACTED] also found proof of animal abuse through the overcrouding of cows into a tiny enclosure at this location at coordinates X:2942 Y:64 Z: 763. As they continued to explain more about these acts of horror, they mentioned this, 

> “At a location around Coordinates X:-950 Y:64 Z:369, I saw foxes trapped in industrial farms full of spiky berry bushes. I can’t imagine the pain felt by those poor foxes.” 
	
While  [REDACTED] couldn’t document the treatment of the foxes, they have provided photo evidence of other actions below. 
	
> “While villager trading halls are somewhat acceptable as the participants are paid in emeralds for their goods (despite being confined to a 1x1 meter sized living space) the act of forcing these people into performing unpaid physical labor is inhumane.”  

[REDACTED] continued,

 > “And they said they were ‘far different from other communest organizations, yet it is still the same: forced labor of innocents while the elite benefit. What a shame to think that they could be worth joining.”

 [REDACTED] then stood up and suddenly left. I was later contacted by them with this message,

 > “I think they are on to me. Please black out my name from this interview”

That was the last I heard from [REDACTED].
