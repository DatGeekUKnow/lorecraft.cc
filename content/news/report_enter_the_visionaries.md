Hello everyone!

Recently, I released an article about how the commune was the only organization, and about how they were posturing themselves in a hostile way. Towards the middle of that article, I put a call out for those that may be interested in joining a treaty, in which to defend ourselves in case the worst were to occur.

Today, I have the honor and privilege to outline that new organization. We are, "The Visionaries".

## Charter

Our charter can be read below. The charter outlines the base rules of our treaty, and how countries within our organization will interact with each other.
1. All alliance members agree to join a defensive war against any aggressors who attack a member state.
2. The members may vote to go to war, all members must agree.
3. New members should be vouched for by 3 other member countries before membership will be extended

    1. Non-member transactions in the trading city shall have a markup of 125% on each purchase
    2. Non-members may establish stores in the city, however they must pay a fee of 2 diamonds/store/30 IRL days
        1. Diamonds are to be paid to the town treasury, for improvements to be made later on
5. Additions or changes to the charter requires majority vote
