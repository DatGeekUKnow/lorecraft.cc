Each winning player shall be granted the full powers of their respective office– for example, Server Leader #1 may veto a SWAG resolution unilaterally, or Server Leader #2 may do the same unilaterally. However, if multiple players are serving in the same position at the same time, and one of them resigns or is impeached or their office otherwise becomes vacant, it shall *not* trigger another election to replace them as outlined in SWAG Resolution 10.
