## Layout of SWAG

In order to propose and vote on Serverwide Association of Gamer (SWAG) resolutions, a player must be considered "active". Active is defined as being online within 30 days from the proposition of a resolution. If a player is not active, they may not vote on or propose resolutions until they are active.

## Votes within SWAG

Once a resolution is proposed, players will have 72 hours to cast their vote. Votes are cast by reacting with a :thumbsup: or a :thumbsdown: reaction on the resolution. For resolutions not pertaining to SWAG or World Resets only require a simple majority of votes to pass (50% + 1). Resolutions that pertain to the system of SWAG or pertain to World Resets will require a 75% majority vote to pass. There is _not_ a minimum amount of votes required on any resolution.

## Proposing Resolutions & Discussions

Discussions are to take place in the tread below the resolution post.
