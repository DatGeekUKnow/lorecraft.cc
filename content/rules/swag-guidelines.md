## Layout of SWAG

In order to propose and vote on Serverwide Association of Gamer (SWAG) resolutions, a player must be considered "active". Active is defined as being online within 30 days from the proposition of a resolution. If a player is not active, they may not vote on or propose resolutions until they are active.

## Votes within SWAG

Once a resolution is proposed, players will have 72 hours to cast their vote. Votes are cast by reacting with a :thumbsup: or a :thumbsdown: reaction on the resolution. For resolutions not pertaining to SWAG or World Resets only require a simple majority of votes to pass (50% + 1). Resolutions that pertain to the system of SWAG or pertain to World Resets will require a 75% majority vote to pass. There is _not_ a minimum amount of votes required on any resolution.

## Proposing Resolutions & Discussions

Discussions are to take place in the tread below the resolution post. All resolutions should be formatted with title containing "Resolution N". If the proposal is a world reset, the proposal should be titled "World Reset M", notably being a different counter specific to world resets.

If a Resolution is proposed, and then must be changed, it can be edited. When you go to edit it, the following items need to be changed:

1. Title should be changed to "Resolution N.L", N being the original resolution number, and L being the revision number.
2. The change should be made within the body of the proposal
3. At the bottom of the proposal, the number of the revision should be bolded, then a hyphen, then the change that was made.
4. At the end of that revision note, there should be a timestamp of the change. The resolution will then have 72 hours from that point.
5. Admins should be notifed so they can remove all reactions from the post. This resets any progress the resolution has made.
