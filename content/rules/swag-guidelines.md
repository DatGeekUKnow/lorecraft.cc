## Layout of SWAG

In order to propose and vote on Serverwide Association of Gamer (SWAG) resolutions, a player must be considered "active". Active is defined as being online within 30 days from the proposition of a resolution. If a player is not active, they may not vote on or propose resolutions until they are active.

## Votes within SWAG

Once a resolution is proposed, players will have 72 hours to cast their vote. Votes are cast by reacting with a :thumbsup: or a :thumbsdown: reaction on the resolution. For resolutions not pertaining to SWAG or World Resets only require a simple majority of votes to pass (50% + 1). Resolutions that pertain to the system of SWAG or pertain to World Resets will require a 75% majority vote to pass. There is _not_ a minimum amount of votes required on any resolution.

## Proposing Resolutions & Discussions

Discussions are to take place in the tread below the resolution post. All resolutions should be formatted with title containing "Resolution N". If the proposal is a world reset, the proposal should be titled "World Reset M", notably being a different counter specific to world resets.

~~If a Resolution is proposed, and then must be changed, it can be edited. When you go to edit it, the following items need to be changed:~~

Per Resolution 5, SWAG resolutions may no longer be edited. If you would like to edit a resolution, a similar solution is to apply the "voided" tag, and then propose the same resolution with a new number. The voided resolution will be closed and locked.
