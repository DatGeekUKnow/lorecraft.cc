There are 6 server rules that will pertain to every interaction with the server. They are:

1. No Griefing
2. No Stealing
3. No Killing
4. No Hacking
5. No Excessive Swearing
6. Be Respectful

The server admins reserve the right to issue warnings and punishments, including temporary and permanent bans, if any of these rules are violated. Punishments will be issued on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity and frequency of the offense.
