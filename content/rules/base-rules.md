There are 6 server rules that will pertain to every interaction with the server. They are:

1. No Griefing: Griefing is defined as breaking, placing, or otherwise modifying blocks on another player's private property without their permission.
2. No Stealing: Stealing is defined as taking or destroying another player's private property (items, mobs, etc.) without their permission
3. No Killing: Except during PvP situations. All PvPers involved must agree to the fight beforehand for it to be considered a PvP situation.
4. No Hacking
5. No Excessive Swearing: This is a Christian Minecraft server.
6. Be Respectful: Arguing with other players is perfectly fine, but being extremely disrespectful will not be tolerated.

The server admins reserve the right to issue warnings and punishments, including temporary and permanent bans, if any of these rules are violated. Punishments will be issued on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity and frequency of the offense.
