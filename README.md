# Lorecraft Website

Welcome to the GitHub for the Lorecraft.cc webpage!

Have you been looking at the site, and noticed something either:
- Not working properly
- Could be done better
- Could be created to make the experience better

Here is the place to do that! You can affect how this site is created in 2 main ways:

1. Issues (No coding required): The issues tab essentially allows you to put in a ticket for what you would like to see come to the website. By doing this, you allow us to know what you want, and we can continue to ask you questions, and you can track the progress of what we are doing about your ticket.
2. Pulls & Merges (Slight coding required): This is considered an Open Source project. That means that anyone can see the final code. This also means that we do accept help! You can create a pull request, detailing what you are wanting to do, and then when the maintainer approves it, you can begin to work on your own branch of the code. When you finish, you then submit a merge request, and a maintainer will look through your code to ensure it won't break anything else. When it's been accepted, it will be merged into a staging branch, before being merged into production.
